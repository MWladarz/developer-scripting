## How to install

* Download the sample: ![PythonSample_ObjectPt3.zip](files/PythonSample_ObjectPt3.zip)
* Install the sample by copying the contents of the zip file into your user's 'Plug-ins' folder. The easiest way to find this folder is by going to Vectorworks menu Tools -> Options -> Vectorworks Preferences... then in the 'User Folder' tab click on 'Explore...' button and navigate to the 'Plug-ins' sub-folder.
**Note:** it is advisable to create a sub-folder inside 'Plug-ins' and copy the sample files inside. This way all your plug-ins will be organized.
* Run Vectorworks and edit the Workspace (from the menu Tools -> Workspaces -> Workspace Editor) to add the new tool. It can be found under the 'Sample Python' category in the 'Tools' tab of the Workspace editor dialog.

## How the sample works

Similarly to the [Python Sample Point Object](Python%20Sample%20Point%20Object.md) it defines a parametric object.

This sample demonstrates an event-enabled parametric object (see Plug-in Editor). This way the object can manage the parameters better and can respond to events sent from Vectorworks. For example, 'reset' is one event that generates the contents of the object (the visual appearance).
