## How to install

* Download the sample: ![WebLinkImage.zip](files/WebLinkImage.zip)
* Install the sample by copying the contents of the zip file into your user's 'Plug-ins' folder. The easiest way to find this folder is by going to Vectorworks menu Tools -> Options -> Vectorworks Preferences... then in the 'User Folder' tab click on 'Explore...' button and navigate to the 'Plug-ins' sub-folder.
**Note:** It is advisable to create a sub-folder inside 'Plug-ins' and copy the sample files inside. This way all your plug-ins will be organized.
* Run Vectorworks and edit the Workspace (from the menu Tools -> Workspaces -> Workspace Editor) to add the new tool. It can be found under the 'Sample Python' category in the 'Tools' tab of the Workspace editor dialog.

## How the sample works

Similarly to the [Python Sample Point Object (complex)](Python%20Sample%20Point%20Object%20(complex).md) it defines a parametric object.

The sample creates an object in the Vectorworks drawing that represents an image downloaded from a specific web URL.

The sample also demonstrates dialogs to collect and edit data from the user. Notice how the 'Cancel' button works, where changes are discarded.
