## How to install

* Download the sample: ![PythonSample_Object2DPath.zip](files/PythonSample_Object2DPath.zip)
* Install the sample by copying the contents of the zip file into your user's 'Plug-ins' folder. The easiest way to find this folder is by going to Vectorworks menu Tools -> Options -> Vectorworks Preferences... then in the 'User Folder' tab click on 'Explore...' button and navigate to the 'Plug-ins' sub-folder.
**Note:** it is advisable to create a sub-folder inside 'Plug-ins' and copy the sample files inside. This way all your plug-ins will be organized.
* Run Vectorworks and edit the Workspace (from the menu Tools -> Workspaces -> Workspace Editor) to add the new tool. It can be found under the 'Sample Python' category in the 'Tools' tab of the Workspace editor dialog.

## How the sample works

Similarly to the [Python Sample Point Object](Python%20Sample%20Point%20Object.md) it defines a parametric object. But this parametric object is path-based. This means that when placed there is a polygon that defines it, not only a location as it is for the [Python Sample Point Object](Python%20Sample%20Point%20Object.md).

The sample creates parallel lines along the underlying path (you can edit the path with the Reshape tool in Vectorworks)

**Note:** Try zooming out a little before placing the sample object to get better results.
