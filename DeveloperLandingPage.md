Vectorworks (http://www.vectorworks.net) provides an open architecture that allows developers to supplement or replace existing Vectorworks functionality. From the userâ€™s perspective, these new tools, menu commands, and objects are indistinguishable from those built into Vectorworks. As such, they are first class solutions for the user.

The information is separated depending on the area of interest for Vectorworks development into different GitHub repository.
