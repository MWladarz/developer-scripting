Search criteria are designed for use with the criteria API and with worksheets to filter and locate objects by the specified attribute values. Search criteria use the attributes of Vectorworks objects (layer, class, color, line weight, etc.) as a means of selecting and manipulating subsets of items within the file.

## Search Criteria Format

### Syntax

Search criteria in scripts are composed of two parts: the **search attribute type specifier** and the **search value**. The search attribute specifier indicates which attribute will be used to filter objects in the document; the search value specifies the value to be found and matched by the search operation. For example, the search criteria term:

```pascal
(C='Edged')
```

indicates that a search should be performed for any objects whose class is *Edged*. In the criteria term, the C attribute type indicates that the search should be performed on the class attribute of objects in the document. The search value *Edged* indicates what class will be a match in the search operation.

The general syntax for search criteria terms is:

```pascal
(<search attribute type> = <search value>)
```

Parentheses are traditionally used to enclose and indicate individual search terms; they are not required.

### Multiple Search Terms

Multiple criteria terms may be specified in order to narrow the search operation to a more specific subset of objects. Multiple search criteria are created using the `&` operator to chain individual search criteria terms. In the term

```pascal
((L='New Construction') & (C='Phase 1'))
```

two search terms are combined to filter for a specific set of objects, in this case any objects on the layer *New Construction* whose class is *Phase 1*. To narrow the search even further, simply add additional search terms:

```pascal
((L='New Construction') & (C='Phase 1') & (SEL=TRUE))
```

In the example, the selection status attribute type was added, so now only selected objects in the *Phase 1* class on layer *New Construction* will match the search.

### Multiple Search Values

It is also possible to filter for multiple match values using search criteria. Multiple match values use the following syntax:

```pascal
(<attribute type> IN [<search value>,<search value>,...])
```

When a search term is specified in this fashion, objects matching any value in the comma delimited value list will be included in the list of objects matching the search. For example:

```pascal
(R IN ['Part Data','Subassembly Data','Assembly Data'])
```

A search using the above term will match any objects with an attached record matching one of the records in the search list.

## Specialized Searches

In addition to the standard attribute types available for use in search terms, scripts also provide specialized search attribute types for additional flexibility in searching a file.

### Record Field Values

Record fields may be searched for specific matching values using a specialized attribute type to query the field value. The syntax for querying record fields is:

```pascal
(<record name>.<field name>[< = |<> |> |>= |< |<= ><search value>])
```

The record and field names are STRING values and should be enclosed in single quotes. Any one of the optional comparison operators can be used to focus the search on a specific subset of items which have the attached record. For example:

```pascal
('Assembly Data'.'Base Cost' < 250.00)
```

will search for any items with the attached record whose base cost is less than 250.00 dollars.

**[CMP]** undocumented but very useful feature: wildcards `?` and `*` can be used in search values. e.g.

```pascal
('Device'.'Name' = 'VJF_*')
```

will match all fields whose values begin with VJF_. My tests show that you can have multiple instances of `*` and `?` in a search term and they behave quite intelligently. So you can search for strings containing a sub string for example.

### Search Symbol Instances (INSYMBOL)

The `INSYMBOL` attribute specifier will cause the search to enter any symbols encountered and perform a search on the symbols’ definition. For example, suppose you are laying out a large office and wish to count the total number of desk components that will need to be purchased. Your document contains a mixture of individual desk and desk return symbols, plus symbols which are comprised of a combination of the two desk components. A search using the term

```pascal
(S IN ['3660 Desk','3660 LH Return'])
```

will return an inaccurate count, as it does not include instances of those symbols which are themselves inside another symbol. Adding the INSYMBOL type specifier to the term:

```pascal
((S IN ['3660 Desk','LH Return']) & (INSYMBOL))
```

will force the search to enter any symbols encountered and detect any nested instances of the symbols in the search term.

### Search Plug-in Objects (INOBJECT)

The `INOBJECT` specifier causes the search to enter plug‐in objects and also evaluate their component objects. Normally, components of plug‐in objects and symbols are ignored by search criteria. The INSYMBOL and INOBJECT specifiers affect the traversal of the drawing and cause more objects to be evaluated against the search criteria.

For example, to count the number of rectangles in the drawing, including rectangles that are inside symbols and plug‐in objects, use the following:

```pascal
COUNT(INSYMBOL & INOBJECT & (T=RECT))
```

### Search Viewport Instances (INVIEWPORT)

The `INVIEWPORT` attribute specifier will cause the search to enter the annotation space of any viewports encountered and perform a search. For example, you may wish to search for drawing labels, or perhaps dimensions, within the annotation space. A search using the term

```pascal
(S IN [T=DIMENSION])
```

will return an inaccurate count, as it does not include viewport instances. Adding the `INVIEWPORT` type specifier to the term:

```pascal
(S IN (INVIEWPORT)&(T=DIMENSION))
```

will force the search to detect any dimensions in the annotation space of viewports.

In a similar way, you can exclude non‐referenced design layer viewports with the specifier `NOTINDLVP` and exclude referenced design layer viewports with `NOTINREFDLVP`.

```pascal
(S IN (NOTINDLVP)&(PON='Door'))
```
finds all doors that are not in non‐referenced design layer viewports.

```pascal
(S IN (NOTINREFDLVP)&(PON='Door'))
```
finds all doors that are not in referenced design layer viewports.

### Location (LOC)

The `LOC` specifier finds objects that are located within the bounds of a named object, like a fence.

### Symbol Flip Status (ISFLIPPED)

The `ISFLIPPED` attribute specifier will check the flipped status of symbols or other objects. For example, to perform a count of all flipped instances of a particular symbol:

```pascal
((S='3680 Door') & (ISFLIPPED))
```

will find only those instances of the symbol which have been flipped. The `ISFLIPPED` specifier is useful for determining orientation of objects for editing or related tasks.

### Project Sharing criteria

Working Files may be searched for object ownership or modification status.

#### Ownership (OWN)

The owner criteria will test the userid that has checked out an object. The special string `#` will match objects checked out to the current user in the current file.

```pascal
(OWN='rberge')
(OWN='#')
```

The special string `*` will match objects checked out by anyone and exclude objects available to check out. An empty string can be used to match objects available to check out.

```pascal
(OWN='*')
(OWN='')
```

#### Modification status (MODIFIED)

The modification status will match objects that have been modified in the current working file and will be submitted in the next commit.

```pascal
(MODIFIED=TRUE) | (MODIFIED=FALSE)
```

#### Container modification status (MOCMODIFIED)

The container modification status will match objects that have been modified directly. It will also match containers like layers or groups that have contents that have been modified.

```pascal
(MOCMODIFIED=TRUE)
```

### All Objects (ALL)

Using the `ALL` attribute type specifier will select all the objects in the document.
