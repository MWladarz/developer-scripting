# Vectorworks Scripting

Vectorworks provides two options for scripting: Python (as of Vectorworks 2014) and VectorScript.


## Python Scripting

Vectorworks 2014 adds Python (http://www.python.org) language as an alternative to VectorScript for creating menu commands, objects, tools, or general purpose scripts.

You can go to the [Python page](Python/README.md) for more information.

## VectorScript

[VectorScript](VectorScript/README.md) is a Pascal-like language allowing scripting in Vectorworks.
